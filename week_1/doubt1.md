Q: What does from sqlalchemy import create_engine (and the following steps) do?

Detailed Answer:
This is the step where you set up the connection bridge between Python and your database.

SQLAlchemy is a Python library for working with databases.

create_engine is the function that constructs a database engine — basically a reusable connector object that pandas (or SQLAlchemy itself) uses to send SQL commands.

How it works:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi")


Here’s what’s inside the connection string:

postgresql:// → Tells SQLAlchemy which database dialect to use.

root:root → username:password.

localhost:5432 → The host and port where the database is running.

ny_taxi → The database name.

Now engine is an object that represents this connection. You don’t use it to query directly; instead, you pass it to other tools (like pandas).

Example with pandas:

df.to_sql(name="yellow_taxi_data", con=engine, if_exists="replace")


This uses the engine to push your DataFrame into Postgres.

You can also pull data back:

pd.read_sql("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM yellow_taxi_data", con=engine)


Analogy:
Think of create_engine as installing a phone line. You don’t talk directly through it, but once the line is there, pandas and SQLAlchemy can send messages (queries, data) back and forth.

Takeaway:
create_engine = Set up the bridge from Python → Database.
