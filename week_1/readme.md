Week-1
### 🗓️ Phase 1: Refresh Everything (2–3 days)

Goal: Be able to redo everything you learned _without looking at the tutorial._

✅ Checklist:

- [ ]    Launch Postgres container from scratch
    
- [ ]    Write and run ingestion script (in Docker)
    
- [ ]    Create a new table and load data
    
- [ ]    Query data with pgcli / pgAdmin
    
- [ ]    Use Docker Compose to bring everything up
    

⏱️ _If you can do this in 20–30 mins without help, you’ve mastered it._

### 📊 Phase 2: Different Data Ingestion Project (2–4 days)

Goal: Build confidence and flexibility.

✅ Ideas:

- [ ]   Use a **different CSV** (e.g., NYC Green Taxi or a Kaggle dataset).
    
- [ ]   Add a **data cleaning/transformation** step before loading.
    
- [ ]   Write a script that **loads multiple months** automatically (loop + automation).
    

💡 _Tip:_ Treat it like a small project and commit it to GitHub — it becomes portfolio material.

### 📚 Phase 3: Complete SQL Fundamentals (3–5 days)

Goal: Master 80% of what you’ll use in real jobs.

✅ Khan Academy checklist:

- [ ]    SELECT / WHERE / ORDER BY
    
- [ ]    JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
    
- [ ]    GROUP BY / HAVING
    
- [ ]    Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
    
- [ ]    Subqueries and CTEs
    
- [ ]    Window Functions _(optional but powerful)_
    

💡 Real-world bonus: Try writing queries against your **ny\_taxi** database in pgAdmin or pgcli — don’t just learn SQL in isolation.
